My TodoList Project for My Self-Taught
I'm interesting developing since only a few months. When I was a child I was interested in but not professionally. And I'm improving my programming skills.
In this project, I didn't use any framework. I made so many mistakes so I get so much experience. Some of these:
I could use only 2 items in local storage but in the program, every Todos is an item. I didn't plan the algorithms and I rush the code. So if you inspect my codes You will see it's a little weird and so complex. I didn't make use of functions that make very complex and crowded to my code.

If you have any advice I want to hear this. Please inspect my code and share your recommendations.
